This file is meant to outline the general project "to do" list
    It is not meant for outlining "to do" or "fix me" statements for existing code; 
    Those statements will exist within the code itself

TODO:
    - build requirements.txt file for project dependencies
    - database setup script if database doesn't already exist (typically for initial setup)
    - preserving website files in repository
    - write "Docs" support files
    - write test scripts
    - simplify & standardize graph configurations

DONE:
    2020-11-06
        - write dictionaries in settings.py (or build dictionaries from database???)
